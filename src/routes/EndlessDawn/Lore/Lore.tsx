      <h1>Endless Dawn: Lore</h1>
      <b>The Original Races</b>
      <p>
        In an age long past, Eldermyst was a land where the Humans, Dwarves,
        Elves, Trolls, and Orcs coexisted, each race with its own domain and
        destiny. The Trolls and Orcs, however, were embroiled in a bitter and
        enduring rivalry. Their conflicts would shape not only their own fates
        but also the landscape of Eldermyst.
      </p>
      <b>The Birth of Dral’Kath</b>
      <p>
        It was amidst this backdrop of enmity that the Humans, driven by their
        curiosity and the relentless pursuit of power, stumbled upon an ancient
        and dark magic deep within uncharted territories of Eldermyst. This
        group of intrepid Human explorers had uncovered cryptic ruins, remnants
        of a long-forgotten civilization. Within these ruins lay secrets that
        were meant to stay hidden – ancient knowledge and forbidden magic that
        promised immense power but at a terrible cost. The Humans, blinded by
        ambition, delved deeper into these dark arts. As they tapped into this
        ancient magic, it consumed them, transforming them into the Dral'Kath,
        beings of immense darkness and malice. Their transformation marked the
        beginning of an era of fear and despair for Eldermyst.
      </p>
      <b>The Creation of Lumycus</b>
      <p>
        In the face of the Dral'Kath threat, the Elves of Eldermyst, deeply
        attuned to the world's ancient magics, gathered in their sacred groves.
        Under the guidance of their Archdruid, they initiated a ritual of
        creation, drawing on the natural energies at a time when the land's
        magic was most potent. Invoking the elemental forces and infusing them
        with the living essence of the forest, the Elves channeled the vitality
        of Eldermyst’s ancient flora. Through their incantations, the very
        essence of the land materialized into sentient guardians – the Lumycus.
        Born from the harmony of bark, leaf, and mycelium, these beings embodied
        the forest's strength and tranquility. As the ritual concluded, the
        Lumycus arose, ready to stand with their creators against the
        encroaching darkness, representing not just the Elves' will to protect
        their home but also Eldermyst's own resolve to resist the corruption of
        the Dral'Kath.
      </p>
      <b>The Great Alliance</b>
      <p>
        When the Dral'Kath threatened to consume Eldermyst with their darkness,
        the Elves, with the newly created Lumycus, called upon the races to
        unite in defense of their land. The urgency of the threat overshadowed
        past conflicts, and a historic alliance was formed in the Elves'
        enchanted groves, a place imbued with the ancient magics of the world.
        The Dwarves crafted an arcane vessel to contain the Dral'Kath's
        corruption, while the Humans devised potent spells for the entrapment.
        The Trolls and Orcs, their feuds forgotten, joined as frontline warriors
        in the ensuing battle. Together with the Lumycus, who were the
        embodiment of the forest's will, they engaged the Dral'Kath in a fierce
        confrontation. Amidst the tumult of war, the races of Eldermyst worked
        in harmony. As the battle raged, the vessel was activated, drawing the
        Dral'Kath into its depths. Through the valor and sacrifice of all, the
        Dral'Kath were finally ensnared and sealed within the dark chasm known
        as The Abyss, their malevolent force contained.
      </p>
      <b>Tormogs and the Re-Emergence of Dral’Kath</b>
      <p>
        The tale of this great alliance and the entrapment of the Dral'Kath
        faded into legend, treated by many as just a story from a bygone era.
        But as is often the case with such ancient and powerful evils, the
        echoes of the past were destined to resurface… Millenia later, the
        Trolls, driven by their age-old rivalry with the Orcs, unearthed a relic
        from the era of the Dral'Kath. The relic unleashed a cataclysmic
        shockwave of dark energy. This shockwave, born from the corrupt essence
        of the Dral'Kath, irrevocably altered Eldermyst. The Trolls and Orcs,
        once bitter enemies, were fused into a new race - the Tormog - erasing
        their individual identities. The Tormog took the place of Trolls and
        Orcs as a race that embodied their shared history, a blending of
        strengths, cultures, and a dark legacy imprinted by the relic's magic.
        As the shockwave spread, the ancient seals imprisoning the Dral'Kath
        shattered and the dark beings emerged once more, threatening the
        existence of all who stand in their way. The races of Eldermyst, now
        home to the Tormog and Lumycus, must forge new alliances to combat the
        resurgence of an ancient evil. Beckoned heroes must rise to face a world
        where ancient legends, forgotten horrors, and looming shadow of an
        endless dawn have come to life once more.
